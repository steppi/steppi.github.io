Senior Software Engineer at [Quansight Labs](https://labs.quansight.org/) working on
maintaining and improving the open source Scientific Python ecosystem. I'm an active
maintainer for [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pulls?q=steppi), working mostly
on statistical computing and special functions. 

Previously I was a Machine Learning Scientist at [Lendbuzz](https://lendbuzz.com/)
working primarily on credit risk modeling.

Prior to this I worked as a  Scientific Software Developer on the
[INDRA](https://indralab.github.io) team in the
[Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/) at Harvard Medical School. My work at HMS focused
primarily on named entity grounding and disambiguation.

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics at
Florida State University working in the group of [Jinfeng Zhang](https://ani.stat.fsu.edu/~jinfeng/),
focusing on network-aware bioinformatics
data analysis and biomedical text mining. 

You can find an up-to-date list of my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_nbf9ZIAAAAJ&hl=en).

Outside of my work, I am very interested in pure mathematics. In a past life
I aspired to work at the intersection of combinatorics, algebra, and geometry
but circumstances had other ideas. When time permits, I still try to pursue
math as a hobby.
