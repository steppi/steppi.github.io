I'm currently a Scientific Software Developer on the
[INDRA](https://indralab.github.io) team in the
[Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/) at Harvard Medical School. My work focuses
primarily on named entity grounding and disambiguation and blurs the boundaries
between software engineering and data science.

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics at
Florida State University working in the group of [Jinfeng Zhang](https://ani.stat.fsu.edu/~jinfeng/),
focusing on network-aware bioinformatics
data analysis and biomedical text mining. I like to work with the [Python
Scientific Computing Ecosystem](https://www.scipy.org/about.html). I try to
take a principled approach to machine learning with an emphasis on validation,
interpretability, data quality, and understanding of the limitations of
algorithms in the context of the systems in which they participate.

Outside of my work, I am very interested in pure mathematics. In a past life
I aspired to work at the intersection of combinatorics, algebra, and geometry
but circumstances had other ideas. When time permits, I still try to pursue
math as a hobby.
