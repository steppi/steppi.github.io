title:  "On a surprising relationship between statistical physics and machine learning"
published: true
---

### Introduction
On August 24th, 2021 a very interesting paper was published in the
[Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/) with the title
[The Fermiâ€“Dirac distribution provides a calibrated probabilistic output for binary classifiers](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/34/e2100761118) [[1]](#1). The
authors report on a "suprising relationship between the probability
of a sample belonging to one of the two classes and the Fermi-Dirac distribution
determining the probability that a fermion occupies a given single-particle
quantum state in a physical system of noninteracting fermions." They
describe a method for calibrating the probabilities predicted by a
binary classifier and a method for ensembling disparate classifiers, each based
upon this suprising relationship. The connection between binary
classification and statistical physics is indeed remarkable but it is not novel.
The authors are in fact discussing applications of the venerable method known
as [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression).
The authors claim that their method is
distinct from logistic regression but they are mistaken. Let's trace through
the paper with a view to understanding this surprising connection. The authors
of the paper may be surprised to find that the end result is not that their
research topic is less rich than they believe, but that logistic regression is a
richer and more interesting method than they've imagined.

The sections on statistical physics will likely appear to dwell too much
on the basics for those already familiar with the subject and likewise for the
sections on statisical machine learning. This was unfortunately difficult to avoid
because my goal is that this post be accessible to people from both audiences.
Feel free to skim or skip through any passages that appear tedious to you.

### Review of Fermi-Dirac Statistics
First let's give a brief introduction to the basics of [Fermi-Dirac statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac_statistics). I'll
try to make the presentation accessible to those from a general mathematically
literate audience who may not have experience with modern physics. We're only
going through the minimum background necessary, describing the mathematical
properties of this model without going into any of the underlying physics.


The problem concerns systems of many indistinguisable and non-interacting 
elementary particles called
fermions. Systems of non-interacting particles are also known as
gases and the systems of interest are known as
[Fermi gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_gas).


Each fermion can be thought of as having an energy associated to it which comes
from a discrete set of nonzero values

$$\mathcal{E} = \left\{\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \ldots, \epsilon_m\right\}$$

without loss of generality we suppose

$$0 < \epsilon_1 < \epsilon_2 < \ldots < \epsilon_m$$

each fermion has a state associated to it which also comes from a discrete
set of values

$$\mathcal{S} = \left\{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_M\right\}$$

and there is mapping from states onto energy levels such that any particle
in state $$s_i$$ will have energy $$\epsilon_j$$ for some fixed $$j$$, but
multiple states can have the same associated energy.

Suppose there are $$g_i$$ states associated to energy level $$\epsilon_i$$.
$$g_i$$ is referred to as the degeneracy of the system at energy level
$$\epsilon_i$$. The unique properties of a Fermi gas are due to fermions
obeying something called the  [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle). This principle asserts that within a system,
at most one particle can occupy any given state $$s_i$$. There is elegant math
and physics lurking behind this principle but it is outside the scope of this
post. We will take it as given within the mathematical model.

Fermi-Dirac statistics concerns the distribution of energy values for particles
within a Fermi gas with known possible energy levels and
where the total number of particles $$N$$ and the total energy
$$E$$ within the system are known. $$N$$ is assumed to be sufficiently large to
allow for some simplifications that we will see shortly. The problem is to
determine the distribution $$\pi(\epsilon\left|N, E\right.)$$ describing the
probability that a state $$s$$ is occupied given its associated energy level
$$\epsilon$$ and with fixed $$N$$ and $$E$$.

There are multiple ways to derive the correct distribution. The most relevant
for this post is based on an approach initiated by Austrian physicist
[Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann) and developed
by American physicist [Josiah Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs) in the 19th 
century [[2]](#2) and first applied to the problem of Fermi-Dirac statistics by the British
physicist [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac) in 1926 [[3]](#3). The correct distribution was also derived independently by the
Italian physicist [Enrico Fermi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi)
in 1926 by a different method [[4]](#4).

Suppose that any arrangement
of $$N$$ total fermions among the 
$$M = \sum_{i=1}^{m}g_i$$ states in $$\mathcal{S}$$ is equally likely.
Given a random distribution of $$N$$ fermions among the $$M$$ states, we ask:

Given a sequence of natural numbers

$$\mathbf{n} = \left(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_m\right)$$

such that

$$\sum_{i=1}^{m}n_i = N$$

and

$$0 <= n_i <= g_i$$

for each $$i$$.

what is the
probability $$\pi(\mathbf{n})$$ that $$n_i$$ of the $$g_i$$ states at
energy level $$\epsilon_i$$ are occupied for each $$i$$?


The problem is in essence a simple combinatorial puzzle. The number of ways to
distribute $$N$$ identical fermions among $$M$$ states is given by the [binomial
coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient)

$$\binom{M}{N} = \binom{g_1 + g_2 + \cdots + g_m}{N}$$

(recall that by the Pauli exclusion principle, at most
one fermion can occupy any given state). Similarly, the number of ways to distribute
$$n_i$$ fermions among the $$g_i$$ states at energy level $$\epsilon_i$$ is given by
the binomial coefficient $$\binom{g_i}{n_i}$$. Through the [rule of product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_product)
we see that the total number of ways to distribute the $$N$$ fermions among the $$M$$ states with
$$n_i$$ fermions occupying the $$g_i$$ states at energy level $$\epsilon_i$$ for $$\mathbf{n}$$ satisfying the
properties above is

$$\operatorname{W}\left(\mathbf{n}\right) = \prod_{i=1}^{m}\binom{g_i}{n_i}$$

and thus

$$\pi(\mathbf{n}) = \frac{\operatorname{W}\left(\mathbf{n}\right)}{\binom{M}{N}}$$

The standard way to solve the problem from here is to attempt to find the value of
$$\mathbf{n}$$ that maximizes the probability $$\pi(\mathbf{n})$$ given the additional
constraint that the total energy is equal to $$E$$. You may have noticed that this is a challenging
discrete problem and that it is ill posed in the sense that for many values of $$E$$ and
$$N$$ there is no choice of $$\mathbf{n}$$ that even satisfies the constraints. This is
handled by passing to the continuous [relaxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(approximation))
of the discrete problem. That is, we no longer restrict the $$n_i$$'s to be natural numbers, but allow
them to take on real values as well. It suffices to maximize $$\log W\left(\mathbf{n}\right)$$ subject
to the constraints since the map $$x \rightarrow \log\left(x \binom{M}{N}\right)$$ is monotonic and thus $$\pi\left(\mathbf{n}\right)$$ and
$$\log W\left(\mathbf{n}\right)$$ will be maximized for the same values of $$\mathbf{n}$$.

The problem becomes to maximize

$$\log W\left(\mathbf{n}\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{m}\log \binom{g_i}{n_i} = 
\sum_{i=1}^{m}\log \frac{g_i!}{\Gamma(n_i + 1)\Gamma(g_i - n_i + 1)} =$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{m}\log g_i! - \log \Gamma(n_i + 1) - \log \Gamma(g_i - n_i + 1)$$

subject to the constraints

$$\sum_{i=1}^{m}n_i = N,\:\:\:\:\:\:\sum_{i=1}^{m}n_i\epsilon_i = E,\:\:\:\:0 \leq n_i \leq g_i$$

where $$\Gamma$$ is the [Gamma function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function), a generalization
of the factorial to real and complex values which is being used because $$n_i$$ can take on any real
value, and thus the usual formula $$\binom{g_i}{n_i} = \frac{g_i!}{n_i!(g_i - n_i)!}$$ is not valid.
For natural numbers $$n$$, $$n! = \Gamma(n+1)$$.

The quantity $$\log W(\mathbf{n})$$ is proprotional to a quantity known as
the [Boltzmann entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann%27s_entropy_formula) and the Fermi-Dirac distribution is the distribution that
maximizes the Boltzmann entropy among all of those satisfying the constraints.

Since $$\sum_{i=1}^{m}\log g_i!$$ does not depend on $$\mathbf{n}$$, it suffices to maximize

$$-\sum_{i=1}^{m}\log\Gamma(n_i + 1) + \log\Gamma(g_i - n_i + 1)$$

subject to the constraints.

The expression appears unwieldy but can be simplified
with [Stirling's approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation)
in the form

$$\log\Gamma(x + 1) = x\log x - x + O\left(\log x\right)$$

by replacing $$\log \Gamma$$ terms with Stirling's approximation, ignoring error terms,
simplifying, and then ignoring terms that do not depend on $$\mathbf{n}$$ we end up
with the problem of maximizing

$$-\sum_{i=1}^mn_i\log(n_i) + (g_i - n_i)\log(g_i - n_i)$$

again subject to the constraints

$$\sum_{i=1}^{m}n_i = N,\:\:\:\:\:\:\sum_{i=1}^{m}n_i\epsilon_i = E,\:\:\:\:0 \leq n_i \leq g_i$$

(As an aside, note that we haven't justified ignoring the error terms. It's common in physics
to treat error terms as negligible when deriving a mathematical model. There
are often implicit assumptions baked into the treatment of certain terms as
negligible. Agreement with experiment remains the ultimate test of physical
theory. It will serve a mathematician well to become comfortable working
non-rigorously like a phycisist; one can cover more ground that way. A vital
skill for a mathematician is then to be able to convert a loose argument into
a rigorous one or otherwise to identify when obstructions make this
difficult or impossible. See [here](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/)
for an excellent post on this matter by an immeasurably more skilled and knowledgeable mathematician.)

This constrained optimization problem can be solved by the method of [Lagrange multipliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier).
(Technically, since some of the constraints are inequalities, one actually applies the
[Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions).)

one can then find the optimal value for $$\mathbf{n}$$ to be

$$\hat{n}_i = \frac{g_i}{1 + e^{\alpha + \beta\epsilon_i}}\:\:\:i=1\ldots m$$

for real constants $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ for which there is no closed form solution except in special cases.
These constants have a physical interpretation that we will not discuss here. The probability $$\pi(\epsilon |N, E)$$
that a state $$s$$ is occupied given its energy level and for fixed $$N$$ and $$E$$ is then taken to be

$$\pi(\epsilon |N, E) = \frac{\hat{n_i}}{g_i} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{\alpha + \beta\epsilon_i}}$$

This expression may look familiar if you've seen logistic regression before. Observe that it has no dependence on the values of the individual $$g_i$$s.
The resulting probability distribution is known as the
[Fermi-Dirac distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac_statistics#Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac_distribution).

You may not be entirely satisfied with the above derivation. We haven't really
explained why we should expect this approach to yield the correct distribution.
You may may be more satisfied by the following interpretation.

Through a series of simplifications we see that the quantity we are maximizing satisifes the equivalence


$$-\sum_{i=1}^mn_i\log n_i + (g_i - n_i)\log(g_i - n_i) =$$

$$-g_i\sum_{i=1}^m\frac{n_i}{g_i}\log\frac{n_i}{g_i} + (1 - \frac{n_i}{g_i})\log\left(1 - \frac{n_i}{g_i}\right) + \log g_i$$

maximizing it under the constraints is then equivalent to maximizing

$$-\sum_{i=1}^m\frac{n_i}{g_i}\log\frac{n_i}{g_i} + (1 - \frac{n_i}{g_i})\log\left(1 - \frac{n_i}{g_i}\right)$$

letting $$p_i = \frac{n_i}{g_i}$$ and interpreting $$p_i$$ to be the probability that a state $$s$$ of energy level $$\epsilon_i$$ is occupied
for fixed $$N$$ and $$E$$, the above expression becomes

$$-\sum_{i=1}^mp_i\log p_i + (1 - p_i)\log\left(1 - p_i\right)$$

you may recognize this expression as the [Shannon entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) of a discrete probability
distribution.

(If you've not yet read Claude Shannon's landmark paper
*A Mathematical Theory of Communication* [[5]](#5), please read it.
If you've read it before, perhaps read it again (I plan to shortly). You can
find it online [here](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf). It is accessible to anyone capable of following this post
and filled with important insights and deep wisdom.)

We thus see that the Fermi-Dirac distribution is the distribution that
maximizes the Shannon entropy under the constraints that the total number
of particles $$N$$ and the total energy $$E$$ are fixed. By the
[principle of maximum entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy), we see that the Fermi-Dirac distribution makes the fewest assumptions
about the true distribution given the constraints that $$N$$ and $$E$$ are
fixed at particular values. The Fermi-Dirac distribution thus has a theoretical
elegance to it and its agreement with experiment may give one the
(justified in my opinion) impression that statistical physics is rooted in
profound truths about the world.

This direct connection between Shannon entropy and Boltzmann entropy was first made
by [E.T. Jaynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes) [[6]](#6)
who developed an interpretation of statistical physics as an application of
Bayesian inference and information theory. His posthumously published book
[Probability theory: The logic of science](http://www.med.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/bios601/GaussianModel/JaynesProbabilityTheory.pdf) [[7]](#7) offers a
fascinating look into his thought on the foundations of Bayesian probability and
inference.

### Review of binary classification

Now let's give a quick review of the binary classification
problem. I think the best references for this sort of material are the book
[The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman [[8]](#8); and for those who use Python,
the excellent [Sci-kit learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) [[9]](#9).

Suppose we are given a set $$\mathbf{X}$$ consisting of points
in a $$p$$ dimensional Euclidean space $$\mathbb{R}^p$$. An example of such
points could be vectors consisting of pixel intensities from $$4000\times 4000$$
grayscale images. In this case $$p = 4000\times 4000 = 16,000,000$$. (The
individual coordinates of the vectors are often called features. We might
say elements of the image dataset above each have 16 million features.) There
is an unknown function $$f: \mathbf{R}^p \rightarrow \left\{0, 1\right\}$$ 
which maps $$\mathbf{x}$$ to an associated target $$y$$ that is either 0 or 1
depending on whether $$\mathbf{x}$$ belongs to some class of interest. An
example could be a function mapping $$4000\times 4000$$ pixel grayscale images
to 1 if an image contains a cat and 0 if it does not. We then consider the
following problem:

Given a subset $$\mathcal{X}$$ consisting of $$n$$ points from $$\mathbf{X}$$
along with a set of $$n$$ corresponding labels $$\mathbf{y}$$ for the
points in $$\mathcal{X}$$, find a function $$\hat{f}: \mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}$$ from a family of functions 
$$\mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol\alpha)$$ parametrized by  $$\boldsymbol\alpha \in
\mathbb{R}^{k}$$ and a decision rule 
$$\mathcal{r}:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \left\{0, 1\right\}$$ such that
the composition $$\mathcal{r} \circ \hat{f}: \mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \left\{0, 1\right\}$$ closely approximates the unknown function $$f$$. For example, if
given a collection of 2 million $$4000 \times 4000$$ pixel grayscale images,
each labeled as to whether the image contains a cat, we are essentially trying to
find a function that is able to identify whether any $$4000 \times 4000$$ pixel
grayscale image contains a cat. The set $$\mathcal{X}$$ is referred to as the
training data.

(Note that we are only discussing a special case of the classification
problem where there is a fixed but unknown function $$f$$. Often it's actually
the case that there is uncertainty in the output of $$f$$, so that the same
point $$\mathbf{x}$$ may have different labels in different cases, perhaps
dependent on some unobserved variables or due to inherent randomness.
For the cat pictures example, it's somewhat sensible to
say that $$f$$ is fixed. If one were to try to predict movement in the stock market
from past movements, $$f$$ is anything but fixed. Restricting to the case of fixed
$$f$$ simplifies the discussion in some places while doing no real harm to the
generality of the results.)

A family of functions $$\mathcal{F}\left(\boldsymbol\alpha\right)$$, along with
an algorithm which when given a set of training data attempts to find a good
choice of $$\boldsymbol\alpha$$ to determine the function $$\hat{f}$$, is called
a classification model. We say a classification model is fitting a function
$$\hat{f}$$ based on the training data $$\mathcal{X}$$ and this process is called
training. After fitting we say we have trained a classification model. Examples of classification models
include [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression),
[decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree),
[support vector machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine),
[random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest),
[gradient boosted tree ensembles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting), and [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network).

For some classification models such as logistic regression and random forests,
the function $$\hat{f}$$ maps points in $$\mathbf{X}$$ to properly calibrated
probabilities that the associated objects belong to the category of interest.
Such methods can produce functions which when given an image return a
probability that it contains a cat. If you were to look at many such images
where the predicted probability is $$0.65$$, you should expect that approximately
65%
of them actually do contain a cat. The decision function $$\mathcal{r}$$ is
then determined by choosing a probability threshold $$p$$ such that 
$$\mathcal{r}(x) = 1$$ if $$x \geq p$$ and equals $$0$$ otherwise.

Other methods such as support vector machines and gradient boosted trees do
not produce functions $$\hat{f}$$ that return calibrated probabilities.
Gradient boosted trees models produce predicted values in the interval
$$\left[0, 1\right]$$ but they tend to cluster at the tails, making predictions
that either under or over estimate the true probabilities. A support vector
machine identifies a hyperplane in $$\mathbb{R}^p$$ which separates points
with label $$1$$ from points with label $$0$$. The function $$\hat{f}$$ gives the
signed distance between a point and the hyperplane so the decision rule
$$\mathcal{r}$$ identifies the side of the hyperplane on which a point lies.

In either case, it is customary to arrange things such that if
$$\hat{f}(x_1) > \hat{f}(x_2)$$, then the classifier
believes $$x_1$$ is more likely to be in the class of interest
(e.g. to be a picture of a cat)
than $$x_2$$ and the decision rule $$\mathcal{r}$$ is based on a
cutoff value $$x_0$$ such that $$\mathcal{r}(x) = 1$$ if $$x \geq x_0$$
and equals 0 otherwise. From now on we will assume this to be the case.

A natural problem is then: given a classification model
which does not produce calibrated probability scores and a function $$\hat{f}$$
fit by this model, to identify an additional function
$$\mathcal{c}:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow [0, 1]$$ such that
$$\mathcal{c} \circ \hat{f}: \mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow [0, 1]$$ produces
correctly calibrated probabilities. Typically $$\mathcal{c}$$ is fit with
another classification model which takes the scores returned by $$\hat{f}$$
on a set of labeled points as its training data. This problem is known
as the problem of probability calibration and it is the primary problem
considered by the authors of [[1]](#1).

### Probability calibration through Fermi-Dirac statistics

The authors of [[1]](#1) consider a classification model $$\mathcal{M}$$
which has fit a function $$\hat{f}$$ which does not return calibrated
probabilities.

Given a set of labeled training data $$\mathcal{X}_1$$ with $$n$$ elements
and that is disjoint from the training data that was used to fit $$\hat{f}$$,
to each point $$\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}_1$$ they associate the
score $$\hat{f}(\mathbf{x})$$. The scores are then sorted in order from highest
to lowest. Scores corresponding to points for which the classifier is more
confident belong to the class of interest appear before points for which
it is less confident.
Scores are then
replaced with their ranks within this sorted list, so that each point in
$$\mathcal{X}_1$$ is mapped to a natural number between $$1$$ and $$n$$ such
that if $$\mathbf{x}_i$$ is mapped to a lower number than $$\mathbf{x}_j$$, then
the classifier is more confident that $$\mathbf{x}_i$$ belongs to the class of
interest. The authors assume that ties are broken uniformly at random.

If $$\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbf{X}$$, let $$N(\mathcal{X})$$ stand for the
number of points in $$\mathcal{X}$$ with true label $$y = 1$$.

The authors then envision a collection of $$g - 1$$ subsets taken through
independent and identically distributed samples from the collection

$$\mathcal{A} = \left\{\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbf{X}:\: |\mathcal{X}| = |\mathcal{X}_1| =  n \text{ and } N(\mathcal{X}) = N(\mathcal{X}_1) \right\}$$

($$\mathcal{X}_1$$ is also assumed to have been drawn iid from the same distribution.)

Call these subsets $$\mathcal{X}_2, \ldots, \mathcal{X}_{g}$$.

To each $$\mathcal{X}_i$$, apply the same procedure that was applied to
$$\mathcal{X}_1$$ to assign a rank between $$1$$ and $$n$$ to each
$$\mathbf{x} \subset \mathcal{X_{i}}$$.

My understanding is that the authors propose the following formal mapping onto the problem investigated
through Fermi-Dirac statistics. Consider the [disjoint union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union)

$$\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{X}_1 \sqcup \mathcal{X}_2 \sqcup \cdots \mathcal{X}_g$$

Each $$s \in \mathcal{S}$$ is considered to be a possible state for a fermion.
By construction each
$$s \in \mathcal{S}$$ belongs to one and only one of the
$$\mathcal{X}_i$$s. If $$s \in \mathcal{X}_i$$, the rank $$\epsilon$$ of $$s$$
in $$\mathcal{X}_i$$ as calculated above is assigned to $$s$$ as its energy.

The state $$s$$ is considered to be occupied by a fermion if the true label
corresponding to the point $$s$$ is $$1$$ (e.g. grayscale images containing
cats are occupied by fermions), otherwise the state is considered to be
unoccupied. 

Each state $$s$$ can be occupied by at most one fermion by construction and
thus the Pauli exclusion principle holds. By construction, the degeneracy
of each energy level is $$g$$.
Each of the $$X_i$$s contains the same number of fermions $$N^{'}$$ and
total number of fermions is $$N = N^{'}g$$.

The total energy $$E$$ is equal to

$$E = \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}}\left[f(s) = 1\right]\operatorname{rank}(s)$$

where $$[\star]$$ is the [Iverson bracket notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iverson_bracket) defined by $$[\star] = 1$$ if $$\star$$ is true, otherwise
$$[\star] = 0$$. Recall that $$f$$ is the unknown function that maps each
$$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{X}$$ to its true label $$y$$. $$\operatorname{rank}(s)$$
is defined as the rank of $$s$$ in $$\mathcal{X}_i$$ for the unique (by
construction) $$\mathcal{X}_i$$ such that $$s \in \mathcal{X}_i$$.

If $$N$$ and $$E$$ are known, then the probability $$\pi(k| N, E)$$ that a
datapoint s has true label 1 given that $$\operatorname{rank}(s) = k$$
can be estimated by the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The authors stress that this
is not necessarily the true probability that the true label is 1 given the rank,
but is the distribution that makes the minimal number of assumptions given
the constraints.

In the construction above $$N$$ is known but $$E$$ is not. However, $$E$$ can
be estimated based on the labeled dataset $$X_1$$, for which the energy *can*
be calculated. If $$X_1$$ has total energy $$E^{'}$$, then the total energy
$$E$$ can be estimated as $$E \approx E^{'}g$$. 

Calibrated probability scores can then be computed through the formula

$$\operatorname{Prob}\left[f(s) = 1\right] \approx \frac{1}{1 + e^{\alpha + \beta \operatorname{rank}(s)}}$$

Note that $$\mathcal{X}_2, \ldots, \mathcal{X}_g$$ need only exist in thought
and are included only to create a closer alignment with the presentation of
Fermi-Dirac statistics given above. Calibrated probability scores for unseen
datapoints
$$\mathbf{x}$$ not in $$\mathcal{X}_1$$ can be computed by calculating
$$x = \hat{f}(\mathbf{x})$$, situating it among the sorted scores from

$$\mathrm{Scores} = \left\{\hat{f}(\mathbf{x}_i):\: \mathbf{x}_i \in \mathcal{X}_1\right\}$$

and assigning it the rank of the nearest score in the set $$\mathrm{Scores}$$,
perhaps making a determination to always assign the smaller rank if 
$$\hat{f}(\mathbf{x})$$ is at the midpoint of two neighboring scores.

Those who are familiar with logistic regression may feel something is a
little suspicious. Haven't they just fit a logistic regression model using
rank transformed features? Let's see what the authors have to say about it

*Some methods, however, explicitly model the posterior probability of their
classification, for example using logistic
regression or Platt scaling methods (43), performing a logistic
transformation of chosen features in the former or of a classifier score
in the latter, into an output probability. While such
transformations make intuitive sense and work well for some
applications, they are heuristic methodologies. Our approach is
different from the abovementioned methods on two counts: On
the one hand, our logistic transformation transforms the ranks
(not features or scores) assigned by a classifier to items in a test
set into a probability; on the other hand, the logistic transformation
is not postulated as an ad hoc transformation but results
from the maximum-entropy principle and as such is the least-biased
distribution given the information at hand. In other words,
ours is the most parsimonious calibrated class distribution, and,
in the absence of additional information, should be preferred to
other methods.*

OK, they've fit a function

$$p(r) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{\alpha + \beta r}}$$

mapping ranks to probabilities that has the same functional form as what would
be produced by a logistic regression model. Are the parameters $$\alpha$$ and
$$\beta$$ somehow different from the ones logistic regression would fit? Does
this mean that logistic regression somehow produces parameters $$\alpha$$ and
$$\beta$$ that are suboptimal because it is only a heuristic methodology
while their method produces better parameters because it is the least biased
distribution given the information at hand? Have statisticians really been
doing it wrong for all these years? Well... it's unfortunate that the
reviewers let the passage quoted above through, because it turns
out that logistic regression is actually characterized by producing the
distribution that is the least-biased given the information at hand.

### The Max Entropy classifier is Logistic Regression is the Max Entropy classifier

Wait, one may say: "I don't recall reading anything about logistic regression
producing a maximum entropy distribution in *The Elements of Statistical
Learning* nor in Agresti's classic textbook *Categorical Data Analysis* 
[[10]](#10) which contains hundreds of pages devoted to logistic regression
and its applications."

I would be astonished if the authors of these books were not aware of this fact
about logistic regression. It's not entirely clear why no mention is made
of it. The mathematical details are certainly not beyond the level of things
that are presented in the first of these books. Each book is already quite
long, but I think it could at least have merited an exercise.


In any case, one can find
a lucid exposition in a 1996 paper by Berger et al [[11]](#11) entitled
*A Maximum Entropy Approach to Natural Language Processing*. There is a nice 2011 article by John Mount, which can be found on github
[here](https://github.com/WinVector/Examples/blob/main/dfiles/LogisticRegressionMaxEnt.pdf) [[12]](#12) and from which I first learned the details of this equivalence.

Suppose we have a labled dataset $$\mathcal{X}$$ with elements from a larger
set of mostly unlabled data $$\mathbf{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^p$$. We seek a function
$$\pi:\:\mathbf{X}\rightarrow [0, 1]$$ such that $$\pi(\mathbf{x})$$ gives
an estimate that the true label corresponding to $$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{X}$$
is 1 for any $$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{X}$$.

Following either of the references from this section, one can show that
logistic regression can be derived by considering $$\pi$$ satisfying
the following constraints

$$0 \leq \pi(x) \leq 1,\:\: \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{X}$$

$$\sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}}\pi(\mathbf{x})x_i = 
\sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}}[f(\mathbf{x}) = 1]x_i,\:\: i = 1\ldots p$$ 

where $$x_i$$ denotes the ith coordinate of $$\mathbf{x}$$.

(The first constraint ensures that $$\pi$$ produces valid probabilities.
The second asks that the sum in each particular coordinate over all values
in the training data with label $$1$$ is equal to the expected sum over that
coordinate under the distribution $$\pi$$).


From all functions $$\pi$$ satisfying the constraints, one chooses that
which maximizes the Shannon entropy

$$H(\pi, \mathcal{X}) = -\sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}}\pi(\mathbf{x})\log(\pi(\mathbf{x})) + (1 - \pi(\mathbf{x}))\log(1 - \pi(\mathbf{x}))$$

Note that when $$p=1$$ these are equivalent conditions to those we used
to derive the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The fitted function is thus exactly
the same.

Now consider the standard method of deriving logistic regression, let's work
in the case where $$p = 1$$ for simplicity. One assumes that $$\pi(x)$$
follows the functional form

$$\pi(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{\alpha + \beta x}}$$

and from there one attempts to maximize the log-likelihood

$$\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{X}| \alpha, \beta) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} [f(x) = 1]\log \pi(x) + [f(x) = 0]\log(1 - \pi(x)) =$$

$$-\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}}[f(x) = 1]\log(1 + e^{\alpha + \beta x}) + [f(x) = 0]\log(1 + e^{-\alpha - \beta x})$$

(The signs of $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ have been flipped from the standard
presentation of logistic regression in order to make things more closely
match the presentation of Fermi-Dirac statistics given above.)

This is an unconstrained optimization problem, we thus proceed by finding values
$$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ for which the gradient of $$\mathcal{L}$$ equals $$0$$.

Through some simplifications we find

$$\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\alpha} = -\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} (1 - \pi(x))\left[f(x) = 1\right] + \pi(x)[f(x) = 0]$$

$$\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\beta} = -\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} x(1 - \pi(x))\left[f(x) = 1\right] + x\pi(x)[f(x) = 0]$$

from which it's possible to derive the constraint

$$\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}}\pi(x)x = 
\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}}[f(x) = 1]x$$ 

By working through the equations for each method, one can see that the standard
method produces the same $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ as the max entropy method.

OK, so it turns out that the authors do seem to be fitting a logistic regression
of some kind. But
what of their claim that their method differs from logistic regression because
"our logistic transformation transforms the ranks (not features or scores)
assigned by a classifier to items in a test set into a probability"?

I admit that in all of the occasions I've reached for Platt scaling, I never
considered whether it might be beneficial to rank transform the predicted
scores before fitting logistic regression. This doesn't mean they are
not fitting a logistic regression though, it only means they are applying a
feature transform. A crude version could be implemented in Python with numpy
and Scikit-learn like this


```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator
from sklearn.base import TransformerMixin
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline


class RankTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """Apply rank transform to features

    Warning: not production ready
    """
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        self.train_sorted = np.sort(X, axis=0)
        return self

    def transform(self, X, y=None):
        n, p = X.shape
        assert p == self.train_sorted.shape[1]
        ranks = np.hstack(
            [
                np.searchsorted(self.train_sorted[:, i], X[:, i]).reshape(n, 1)
                for i in range(p)
            ]
        )
        return ranks + 1
```

Implementing a Fermi-Dirac classifier is then as simple as

```python
fermi_dirac_classifier = Pipeline(
    [
        ('rank_transform', RankTransformer()),
        ('logit', LogisticRegression(penalty=None, solver="newton-cg"))
    ]
)
```

The authors go on to discuss a method they call FiDEL which amounts to
the method of pooling probabilities predicted by different methods by taking the
geometric mean of the resulting odds ratios. A discussion of the merits of
this method in comparison to others can be found in a highly relevant paper by
SatopÃ¤Ã¤ et al[[13]](#13). In the case of FiDEL, the scores output by different
classifiers are converted to calibrated probabilities through the author's
physics inspired variant of Platt scaling, and then combined in this way.


## Conclusion

OK, so how does this happen? Why were a group of physicists who are obviously
skilled and mathematically competent unable to detect that they'd
rediscovered known methods? How is it that none of the reviewers
for their PNAS paper were able to point this out to them? I think part of
the answer lies in how vast the sphere of human knowledge really is. It is
beyond anyone to keep up with the details of more than small portions of it.
Research communities focus on their particular sets of problems and
communication between different research communities is often weak to
non-existent. This is not out of laziness, incompetence, or  malevolence, but
because the difficulty of such communication tests our limits. Just keeping
on top of ones own field and publishing consistently is challenging enough.
How to properly review cross-disciplinary research is a difficult problem.

Transitioning from one research field to another is difficult. Over ten years
ago my goal of having a pure math career was upended due to health issues. As
I recovered, my interests switched to machine learning simply because it was an
in demand field with career potential outside of the brutal competition for
faculty jobs. I had some bad takes early on. I was skeptical of the potential
of deep learning
because it seemed ad-hoc and unprincipled. In just a short time I was proven
very wrong. It took over six years from when I changed focus before I
felt capable of developing novel and useful algorithms.

Had I been asked to review this paper, I would not have recommended
rejection. Certainly I would have asked for major revisions, but ultimately
I think this is worthwhile work. I would have pointed out that they were
in fact fitting a logistic regression model and basically made them aware of
all of the contents of this post. I would have asked them to rewrite the paper
with this awareness in mind; to rewrite it as a discussion of the connections
between statistical physics and logistic regression offering a means to
bring physical intuition to binary classification problems.
The paper could have been a bridge between the statistical physics and
statistical machine
learning communities, allowing practioners of each field insight into the other
through discussion of a shared problem. Also, I had never considered the
possibility of rank transforming the features before Platt scaling and the authors
make some compelling arguments for it. Like most techniques it will probably
be beneficial in some cases and harmful in others with empirical performance 
being the final judge, but it's an interesting tool to keep in mind.

**Judgement:**
*The paper is thought provoking in its own right regardless of whether the methods
are novel and is worth a read.*
